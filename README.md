# Software Engineering Workspace Installer (SEWI)
A setup tool for rapidly installing a set of necessary tools to enable professional software development. 

## How it works
A website or program that steps you through choices for each of the categories of tools specified below. The goal is to have descriptions, pros and cons for specific vendors. The vision is that after going through all steps, the user has gotten IaC that it can run to set up everything automatically, or at least a simple "intranet" page which gathers links to all tooling in a convinient place. 

## Tools
* Code repository
* CI/CD Pipeline
* Issue tracking
* Artifactory
* Communication
	* Video
	* Text
	* Email
* Metrics
	* DORA
	* CodeHealth
* Documentation

I will refer to this collection of tools as the Software Engineering Workspace (SEW). It is what I deem to be necessary tools in order to do software engineering professionally. 

## Output
* IaC code to launch configuration
* A simple website with links to all chosen tools to simplify onboarding
